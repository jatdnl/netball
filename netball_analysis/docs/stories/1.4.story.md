# Story 1.4: Jersey Number Tracking System

## Story Information
- **Epic:** 1 - OCR Jersey Reading Integration
- **Story Number:** 1.4
- **Status:** Draft
- **Priority:** High
- **Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours

## Story Statement
As a **developer**,
I want **to create the JerseyNumberTracker module**,
so that **jersey numbers can be tracked over time and validated**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create `core/jersey_tracker.py` with `JerseyNumberTracker` class
2. Implement temporal tracking of jersey recognition results
3. Add confidence-based number determination logic
4. Integrate with existing player tracking system
5. Add methods for retrieving most likely jersey numbers

## Integration Verification
- IV1: Jersey tracking integrates with existing player tracking
- IV2: Tracking system maintains existing player identification
- IV3: Jersey data flows correctly through analysis pipeline

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.3 established the data types (PlayerJerseyData, PlayerJerseyAnalysis) needed for jersey tracking. This story creates the tracking system that will aggregate jersey recognition results over time and determine the most likely jersey numbers for each player.

### Data Models
Based on existing project structure analysis:
- **PlayerJerseyData**: Individual jersey recognition results (from Story 1.3)
- **PlayerJerseyAnalysis**: Temporal tracking aggregate (from Story 1.3)
- **Existing Player Tracking**: Integration with current player identification system
- **JerseyNumberTracker**: New class for managing jersey tracking logic
  - Track jersey recognition results over time
  - Calculate most likely jersey numbers
  - Manage confidence-based determination
  - Integrate with existing player tracking

### API Specifications
- **JerseyNumberTracker.update_jersey_data(player_id: str, jersey_data: PlayerJerseyData) -> None**
- **JerseyNumberTracker.get_player_jersey(player_id: str) -> Optional[int]**
- **JerseyNumberTracker.get_confidence_history(player_id: str) -> List[float]**
- **JerseyNumberTracker.get_player_analysis(player_id: str) -> Optional[PlayerJerseyAnalysis]**

### Component Specifications
- **JerseyNumberTracker Class**: Main tracking system
  - Maintain temporal history of jersey recognition results
  - Calculate most likely jersey numbers based on frequency and confidence
  - Integrate with existing player tracking system
  - Provide methods for retrieving jersey analysis
  - Handle player identification and jersey mapping

### File Locations
Based on existing project structure:
- **New file**: `core/jersey_tracker.py` - JerseyNumberTracker class
- **Integration**: `core/tracking.py` - Will integrate with existing player tracking
- **Data types**: `core/types.py` - Uses PlayerJerseyData and PlayerJerseyAnalysis

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for JerseyNumberTracker class methods
- Integration tests with existing player tracking system
- Temporal tracking tests for jersey recognition over time
- Confidence-based determination tests
- Player identification integration tests

### Technical Constraints
- Must integrate with existing player tracking system
- Temporal tracking must be efficient for real-time processing
- Confidence-based logic must be configurable
- Must handle cases where jersey numbers change or are unclear
- Must maintain existing player identification functionality

### Task 2: Implement Temporal Tracking (AC: 2)
1. Add `update_jersey_data()` method for temporal tracking
2. Implement data structures for storing jersey recognition history
3. Add timestamp-based tracking logic
4. Add methods for retrieving temporal data
5. Add performance optimization for real-time processing

### Task 3: Add Confidence-Based Determination (AC: 3)
1. Implement logic for calculating most likely jersey numbers
2. Add confidence-based weighting for jersey determination
3. Add configurable confidence thresholds

### Task 5: Add Retrieval Methods (AC: 5)
1. Implement `get_player_jersey()` method
2. Implement `get_confidence_history()` method
3. Implement `get_player_analysis()` method
4. Add methods for retrieving tracking statistics
5. Add error handling for missing data

### Task 6: Testing and Validation (AC: 1-5, IV1-IV3)
1. Create unit tests for JerseyNumberTracker
2. Test temporal tracking functionality
3. Test confidence-based determination logic
4. Test integration with existing player tracking
5. Verify jersey data flows correctly through analysis pipeline

## Testing Strategy

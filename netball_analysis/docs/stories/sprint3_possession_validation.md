# Sprint 3 Story 3: Validate Possession Logic

## Story
As a netball analyst, I want the possession tracking system to be thoroughly validated on real gameplay footage so that I can trust the accuracy of possession data for statistical analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Possession tracking tested on 5 different video segments (10s each)
- [ ] Manual validation against ground truth for each segment
- [ ] False positive rate <15% and false negative rate <20%
- [ ] 3-second rule violations manually verified
- [ ] Performance metrics documented (processing time impact)
- [ ] Edge cases handled gracefully (ball out of bounds, player occlusions)

## Tasks
- [ ] Create validation test suite with ground truth annotations
- [ ] Implement automated accuracy metrics calculation
- [ ] Add manual review workflow for possession assignments
- [ ] Test edge cases: ball bouncing, player collisions, camera angles
- [ ] Document common failure modes and solutions
- [ ] Create validation report template

## Technical Details
- Test segments: 5 clips from different games/cameras
- Ground truth: manual annotation of possession changes
- Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score for possession detection
- Edge cases: ball in air, multiple players near ball, partial occlusions
- Performance: measure processing time impact of possession tracking

## Definition of Done
- Validation suite runs automatically
- Accuracy metrics meet acceptance criteria
- Edge cases documented with solutions
- Validation report generated for each test run
- System ready for production use
